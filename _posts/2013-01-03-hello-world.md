For a first post, I would like to briefly explain how I built this blog. If you are tired of Wordpress or others complicated blog engines and are looking for a very simple and effective way to blog, then 
<a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki" title="github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank"><strong>Jekyll</strong></a> is what you are looking for! 
As mentioned in the Github repository, "Jekyll is a blog aware, static site generator in Ruby" and is the simpler way to blog I have seen so far.  

This blog is based on it and is hosted right on 
<a href="https://github.com" title="github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.
Yes, because Jekyll is actually the engine used by Github Pages, it is very simple to host a Jekyll blog on a repository named *"USERNAME.github.com"*.

Dealing with Jekyll means all of these things that are easily integrated and ready to use like for instance
<a href="http://disqus.com/" title="disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> for comments or even
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" title="google.com/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>. 
A lot of html templates are also available using
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="twitter.github.com/bootstrap" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> or others.
I feel a little tired of twitter bootstrap everywhere so I choose to change and to try
<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" title="foundation.zurb.com" target="_blank">Zurb's Foundation</a> which is finally a great alternative!

I think Jekyll is the best way to blog for developers because it allows to work with a blog as we work with any project: use of a git repository, work and test in local, update from the command line..
In addition, what makes Jekyll really interesting for a blog is that it runs text-to-html converters like *Markdown*, *Textile* or *Liquid* and allows the web-writer to add inline html. In other word, you
can write a post in a simple text editor, add some html tags inside, push it to your Github repository and that's it!

The full stack of the blog is simply Github, Jekyll and Zurb's Foundation, you can watch/fork it 
<a href="https://github.com/ThibaultLaurens/thibaultlaurens.github.com" title="github.com/ThibaultLaurens/thibaultlaurens.github.com" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.

What I really like with **Jekyll** so far:
*   **Speed**: it is fast and fast to build a blog with
*   **Light**: there is no database and no hosting problem
*   **Tools**: a lot of "out of the box" tools available
*   **Web-writers** oriented: use of text-to-html converters    

If you want to get started blogging with Jekyll, the best way is probably to check
<a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/" title="jekyllbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Jekyll-Bootstrap</a>, a little framework which makes the process even easier.
